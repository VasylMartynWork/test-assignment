# Test assignment
I implement three tasks:
- The main page displays the top N currencies by popularity on some market
(or top 10 currencies that were returned by API).

- Page with the ability to view detailed information about the currency:
price, volume, price change, in which markets it can be purchased and at what price (the
ability to go to the currency page on the market is a plus).

- Possibility of searching for currency by name or code.
